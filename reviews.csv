Prices are very reasonable comparing with Event cinemas. But not cheaper than Cineplex Australia. The most important thing you need to know is their new renovated seats.

Always love coming here to use the recliner seats and is my ""go to"" cinema because its pretty clean and not cramped spaces between seats *compared to my other experiences* Though I do feel like the customer service could do better.", 4 ,2020/01,0.0,0.71,0.29,0.9382
